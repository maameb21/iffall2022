                Emmy wished on a dragon scale <br>
And that's what started Dragon Tales<br>
Around the room the dragons flew<br>
But Emmy and Max knew what to do<br>
They climbed on the backs of their dragon friends<br>
Now the adventures never end <br>
</p>

<p>Dragon Tales, Dragon Tales<br>
It's almost time for Dragon Tales<br>
Come along and take my hand<br>
Let's all go to Dragon Land<br> </p>

<p>
There's Ord he's the biggest, not so brave of heart<br>
There's Cassie so shy, also very smart<br>
There's Zak and Wheezie and his tales of fun<br>
'Cause you know two heads are better than one<br> </p>

<p>
Dragon Tales, Dragon Tales<br>
It's almost time for Dragon Tales<br>
Come along and take my hand<br>
Let's all go to Dragon Land<br>
Dragon Tales, Dragon Tales<br>
It's almost time for Dragon Tales<br>
Come along and take my hand<br>
Let's all go to Dragon Land</p>
