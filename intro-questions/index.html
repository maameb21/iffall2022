        <h1>Introduction Questions</h1>
        <p1>1. My name is Maame Kyei, I am a major in communication design, and I am a junior </p1>
        <p>2. I would like to learn how to make a simple interactive website on my own</p>
        <p>3.I have a little bit of experience with html, but it doesn't go beyond what we just learned really.</p>
        <p>4. I would like to know more than the rudimentary things I learned about html in the past.</p>
        <p>5. I expect user friendliness and accessibility to be a component of how I design web pages whereas on paper, I really just have to consider the visual component.</p>
        <p>6. I think <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse">Netflix</a>  is a website with pretty effective design because the user experience is pretty easy. For example, you can continue watching multiple series from wherever you stopped so you don't have to keept track of where you were. This is something a lot of sites have implemented that makes the user experience worthwhile.</p>
        <p>7. I think <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/login/canvas" >Canvas</a> is a website with effective communication because its notifications connect directly to student emails.</p>
        <p>8. I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com" >Youtube </a> is a website that works well in the sense that it works the way it is intended, which is to keep up user engagement for long periods of time. For example, when you open the website it provides a home page with videos tailored to the user's preferences in content. This,  along with the algorithmic reccomended feature, makes it almost inevitable for the user to get sucked in and use the app for long stretches of time.</p>
